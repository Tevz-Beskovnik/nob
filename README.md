# nob

Nob is a inspiration base on the [nob.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h.git) written by Tsoding. I take 0 credit for most of the code written here I just wanted to see I can recreate the buildsystem and understand how it works but here using c++ instead of c. 

## What is it

Essentialy it is a no-build system concept where the only thing you need to build your project is `nob.h`, a c++ compiler and knowlage of the c++ language.

However nob is mostlikely not suitable for you if you are relying on external dependencies, via CMake. It's mostly a helper tool to run commands in the shell for you.

## How to use it
